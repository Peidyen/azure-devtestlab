### Artifacts
Contributions to artifacts should follow these high-level guidelines -
- Every artifact should be contained in its own **folder** under the **Artifacts** folder.

- The artifact definition file should be named **Artifactfile.json**. The name of the artifact that shows up in Azure DevTest Labs is from the title field in the artifact definition.

- All dependencies of the artifact (such as scripts, icons etc) should be included in the artifact folder itself.

- It is highly recommended that a **Readme.md** file be included to explain how the artifact works and how to troubleshoot any failures.
